I am just starting out with GitHub. I have used GitHub for a while but i have never created my own projects, written programs/software/applications.
I have operated within the IT Field for approx. 10 years gaining experience and knowledge within the QSR industry, Education, ICT Industry within the top 2 Telco's
and Research&Development of Mobile Communication and Data towers for rural and regional setups. I am currently undergoing my Masters for Cyber-Security
and have already completed my Graduate Certificate for Computer and Network Security. I am also completing a variety of Google, Microsoft and AWS certifications.
